                         Already making history for announcing an unprecedented four-show run at Singapore’s largest venue, Coldplay will now be the first act ever to play five nights at Singapore’s National Stadium. The band also broke Singapore’s record for most tickets sold by an artist in a single day, surpassing 200,000.

                         Since the first Music Of The Spheres World Tour date in March 2022, the band have sold over 7 million tickets - the most for any tour over the last two years. The tour has also received rave reviews from fans and critics alike, picking up accolades including Favorite Touring Artist at the 2022 AMAs and Tour of The Year at the 2023 iHeartRadio Awards.

                         Earlier in June, the band issued an update on the tour’s sustainability initiatives, revealing that, on a show-by-show comparison, their current tour has so far produced 47% less CO2e emissions than their previous stadium tour in 2016/17, and that 5 million trees have already been planted around the world (one for each concert goer).

                         Coldplay have also confirmed they will make a limited number of Infinity Tickets available for the shows at a later date. Infinity Tickets are released for every Coldplay show to make the Music Of The Spheres World Tour accessible to fans for an affordable price. They will cost the equivalent of $20 USD per ticket. They are restricted to a maximum of two tickets per purchaser, and must be bought in pairs (which will be located next to each other).

                         DHL is the Official Logistics Partner of the Music Of The Spheres World Tour, supporting the band in their mission to cut the tour’s direct emissions by 50%.",
